The VenusGRAM C Interface
===========================

This documents the C interface for VenusGRAM.  Since the GRAM framework is common to all models, only the Venus specific information is documented on this page.  See the [C interface](Documentation/Markdown/GRAM_C.md) page for documentation on the common framework.

A simple example of using the Venus atmosphere can be seen [here](@ref Venus/examples/Venus_C.c).

There are no Venus specific settings.  The common framework contains all interface functions.
