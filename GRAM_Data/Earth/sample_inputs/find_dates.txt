 Explanation of variables:
  SpicePath  =  Path to NAIF Spice data
  SpiceLsk   = Optional override of the relative (to SpicePath) path to the Spice leapseconds LSK file.
  SpicePck   = Optional override of the relative (to SpicePath) path to the Spice planetary constants PCK file.
  SpiceEarth = Optional override of the relative (to SpicePath) path to the Spice Earth kernel.
  FindDates  =  0 Run the standard GRAMs routine.
                1 Run the Find Dates routine.

  Month     = month of year                         
  Day       = day of month                    
  Year      = year (4-digit, or 1970-2069 can be 2-digit)
  Hour      = hour of day (in UTC time frame) 
  Minute    = minute of hour (in UTC time frame)                                       
  Seconds   = seconds of minute (in UTC time frame) 

  TargetLongitudeSun = The desired longitude of the sun. 
  TargetSolarTime    = The desires local solar time.    

  InitialLongitude   = initial position longitude, degrees 
                       (depends on EastLongitudePositive)
  EastLongitudePositive =  0 for input and output West longitudes positive
                           1 for East longitudes positive
