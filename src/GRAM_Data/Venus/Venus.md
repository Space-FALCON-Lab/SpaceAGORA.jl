The VenusGRAM C++ Interface
=============================

This documents the \ref GRAM::VenusAtmosphere interface class for VenusGRAM.  Since the GRAM framework is common to all models, only the Venus specific information is documented on this page.  See the [C++ interface](Documentation/Markdown/GRAM.md) page for documentation on the common framework.

A simple example of using the Venus atmosphere class can be seen [here](@ref Venus/examples/Venus.cpp).

There are no Venus specific settings.  The common framework contains all interface functions.
