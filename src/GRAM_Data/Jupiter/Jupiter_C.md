The JupiterGRAM C Interface
===========================

This documents the C interface for JupiterGRAM.  Since the GRAM framework is common to all models, only the Jupiter specific information is documented on this page.  See the [C interface](Documentation/Markdown/GRAM_C.md) page for documentation on the common framework.

A simple example of using the Jupiter atmosphere can be seen [here](@ref Jupiter/examples/Jupiter_C.c).

There are no Jupiter specific settings.  The [common framework](Documentation/Markdown/GRAM_C.md) contains all interface functions.
