# Lunar Landing

A powered descent from orbit to the surface, flown 6-DOF: an Apollo-style
quadratic guidance commands the descent engine's thrust and the attitude that
points it, an RCS attitude controller tracks that attitude, and the terrain
comes from digital elevation maps (DEMs) that serve as the radar altimeter,
stop the run at touchdown, and shape the surface the viewer draws.

`scripts/dev/viewer_demos/apollo11_landing.jl` flies Apollo 11 from powered
descent initiation (PDI, 1969-07-20 20:05:05 UTC, 15.24 km above Tranquility
Base and 480 km uprange on the descent orbit) to touchdown with NASA's lunar
module model and the LROC terrain of the site.

## Terrain models

`DEMTerrainModel` holds one or more `DEMGrid`s (regular latitude/longitude
grids of heights above the body's reference sphere, finest first) and answers
`terrain_height(model, lat_deg, lon_deg)` by bilinear interpolation in the
first grid that covers the point; `NoTerrainModel()` is the flat sphere.
`load_site_terrain("data/terrain/moon/apollo11/site.json")` reads a site
directory written by `scripts/dev/terrain/fetch_moon_site.py`, which fetches:

- the LOLA 128 pixel-per-degree global grid (237 m/px) in a window around the
  site, by HTTP range requests straight out of the PDS raster;
- the LROC NAC digital terrain model of the site (2 m/px, resampled to 4 m)
  where one exists (Apollo 11 does);
- nested imagery patches from NASA Moon Trek, from the LROC WAC global mosaic
  (83 m/px over a 4° window) down to the 26 cm NAC mosaic (0.65 m/px over the
  last 500 m).

```
python3 scripts/dev/terrain/fetch_moon_site.py --site 0.67416 23.47314 --out data/terrain/moon/apollo11
```

The data stay under `data/` (not tracked). Grids are little-endian Float32
files with a JSON header, so other DEMs can be dropped in the same layout.

## Powered descent guidance

`ApolloDescentGuidanceModel` implements the LM guidance computer's quadratic
law (Klumpp, *Apollo Lunar Descent Guidance*, 1974) in a site-fixed frame
(x uprange, y crossrange, z up; velocities relative to the rotating body):

```math
a_c = a_T - \frac{6\,(v_T + v)}{T} + \frac{12\,(r_T - r)}{T^2}
```

with the time-to-go `T` re-solved every cycle from the uprange cubic that adds
a jerk target. Two quadratic phases follow the Apollo programs, P63 braking
(targets beyond the high gate, the phase ends at the high-gate altitude) and
P64 approach (a hover point above the site), then a P66 rate-of-descent phase
nulls horizontal velocity and descends at 1 m/s, 0.5 m/s below 10 m, until
the engine cutoff altitude. `apollo11_descent_targets()` returns targets in
the spirit of Apollo 11's; `DescentPhaseTargets` lets you set your own.

The thrust command is `m |a_c - g|` with the rotating-frame terms included;
the descent engine's throttle follows the DPS envelope (`throttle_min` to
`throttle_max`, 10 to 60 percent, and full thrust above it). The attitude
command points body `-z` (the engine axis) along the thrust with the windows
(body `+x`) along the projection of up plus the flight direction: windows up
during braking, facing the site once the vehicle pitches back.

`ApolloDescentControlModel` throttles the engine toward the command with a
slew limit, runs a rate-limited attitude loop whose torques are bounded by
the RCS authority, applies the thrust along the vehicle's actual engine axis,
and drains propellant through both. The two effectors share an
`ApolloDescentState` (phase, time-to-go, thrust, commanded attitude, radar
altitude, site-frame state, touchdown record). Run the simulation with
`isolate_state=false` when you want to read that state afterwards; the
scenario also saves thrust, throttle, time-to-go, radar altitude, phase and
attitude error as result columns.

When a control effector reports a landing (`touchdown_spec`), the engine
replaces its impact event with a touchdown event on the terrain: the run
ends when the vehicle's reference point reaches `touchdown_height_m` above
the ground and the touchdown time, ground-relative velocity and miss distance
are recorded.

```julia
terrain, site = load_site_terrain("data/terrain/moon/apollo11/site.json")
braking, approach = apollo11_descent_targets()
gcfg = ApolloDescentConfig(site_lat_deg=site.lat_deg, site_lon_deg=site.lon_deg, approach_azimuth_deg=270.0,
    braking=braking, approach=approach)
state = ApolloDescentState(1)
guidance = ApolloDescentGuidanceModel(gcfg, state, terrain)
control = ApolloDescentControlModel(ApolloDescentControlConfig(touchdown_height_m=2.6), gcfg, state, terrain)
# ... GuidanceModel(guidance_effectors=(guidance,), guidance_rates=[2.0]),
#     ControlModel(control_effectors=(control,), control_rates=[0.05]), orientation_sim=true
```

## Surface in the viewer

`export_visualization(prefix; terrain="data/terrain/moon/apollo11/site.json")`
embeds the site's grids and imagery. The page drapes each imagery level over a
patch displaced by the DEM, nested from coarse to fine and drawn all the time,
so the surface sharpens by itself as the camera closes in on the site; the
globe is cut open under the outermost patch. The selection panel gains a
"height above terrain" quantity, and the info panel names the terrain and its
finest resolution.
